# Global deep learning optimized pulse sequence for CEST MRF
The sequences are provided in Bruker `.txt` format and PyPulseq `.seq` format. The clinical `.seq` sequence is spin-lock-based, with a fixed readout (for the simulation), which does not fully correspond to the publication (the flip angle is not varied here). Choosing the scanner type of sequence in `create_seq.py`, i.e., `type_s='scanner'`, will omit the readout entirely and replace it with a pseudo-ADC that instructs the scanner to perform its readout. You can implement a readout sequence that you need and use FA from the `scone.txt` file (3rd column) to fully correspond to the published sequence.

## Description
The folder contains the protocol for brain imaging: 
- B<sub>1</sub> = 0-4 ÂµT
- T<sub>sat</sub> = 0-4 s
- T<sub>R</sub> = 0-4 s 
- Pulse shape: Gaussian 16 ms
